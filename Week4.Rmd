  <h5>Dependence Syndrome</h5>
    <p>A dependence syndrome is a cluster of physiological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena in which the use of a substance takes on a much higher priority than other behaviours that once had greater value for the individual.</p>
    <p>This syndrome can also be referred to as the frequently strong, or overpowering desire to take substance(s)</p>
  <h5>Addiction Effects Family and Friends</h5>
    <p>Family members of an addicted person often suffer from <abbr title="A self-defeating relationship pattern in which a person helps (by protecting the addicted person from the consequences of their behaviour) or encourages addictive behaviour in another. They find it hard to set healthy boundaries and often live in a chaotic, crisis-oriented mode.">codependence</abbr></p>
